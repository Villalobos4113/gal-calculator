Goal: I need to create a calculator code in Wincupl (pld file format) for a GAL22V10 that is able to do addition and subtraction for 4 bits operations between an A [3...0] and a B[3...0], both A and B are binary representations of decimal numbers. The code should be for a GAL22V10 on the software WinCupl.  The calculator also needs to do multiplication for the first three bits in A and B, A[2...0] and B[2...0].

The operation type should be able to be selected by a 2 bits input, O[1...0] for O=00 and O=11 addition, O=01 subtraction and O=10 multiplication.

The code should use standard WinCupl operations: NOR, AND, OR, XOR.

Return Format: I need the code for WinCupl considering a GAL22V10 that has comments for each important variable or function. The code should be programmed in a simple way even for people to understand which means no obscure wincupl functions or external dependencies, only basic operations but still work correctly.

Be careful to make sure that the code correctly sums 4 bits and subtracts 4 bits, the WinCupl code uses standard WinCupl operations of NOR, AND, OR, XOR  when the subtraction is a negative number there should be an output to indicate that 1 for negative, 0 for positive.

For context: I am doing a Logic Circuits project of a calculator that is able to sum, subtract and multiply, this calculator need to be programmed into a GAL22V10 in WinCupl because im goint to connect a display to show the results and a LED, the LED should turn on when the subtraction is negative and the display should indicate the binary number of the result of the subtraction. Im going to use a dipswitch to select which type of operation I want to do like O[1 : 0], si O= 00, addition, O= 01, el subtraction and  O= 10 three bit multiplication. I am going to use a 7448 decoder to translate signals into my BCD 7 segment display.

Operational Requirements: 
- Input PINS: A (PIN[2:5]), B (PIN[6:9]), O (PIN[10:11])
- Output PINS: Output number (PIN[15:22] (least significative bit 22, most significative bit 15)), Negative (PIN[14])
